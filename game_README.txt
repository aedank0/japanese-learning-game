The game is text based, and runs from the console using Python.　After starting, enter "help" to get help.

Requirements:
A way to type in Japanese (Japanese IME)
Latest version of Python 3

Installation:
	Windows:
	In your command prompt you have to be using a font that supports Japanese characters, otherwise they won't appear correctly.
	With your IME Windows should've already installed a font that does, so you just have to enable it for use in the cmd.
	To do so, right click on the top of the Command Prompt window, select Properties, then under the Font section, select NSimSun (not SimSun-ExtB). This temporarily changes the font.
	To change the default font, instead of clicking Properties click Defaults, then follow the same steps.
	After that, if you've alread installed Python then you should be able to just double click to run.
	
	Linux:
	Installing a Japanese IME and a font that supports Japanese can vary widely depending on your distro, so you'll have to Google it.
	After that, you can run it from the shell with ./game.py, but you'll probably have to mark the game.py file as executable with "chmod +x game.py" while in this directory.
	
	Mac:
	I have no idea how to install everything on a Mac. It's probably similar to the two OSs above. Google is your friend.
