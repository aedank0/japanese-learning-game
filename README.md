# Japanese Text-based Learning Game

This is a game I made with Python in 2021 for a project in one of my Japanese courses. The game is text-based and plays somewhat like Zork or similar interactive fiction games, although you need to be able to read and write Japanese to complete it.

game_README.txt is the old readme that originally came with the game.
